# Interactive visualization of Serial's call log data using ggvis

This contains the code behind [this interactive visualization](https://dgrtwo.shinyapps.io/serialApp/) of the call logs from the [Serial podcast](http://serialpodcast.org/). The visualization is described in [this blog post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/shiny-ggvis/)- the app itself is stored in the [serialApp](serialApp/) directory.

The raw data comes from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/thmcmahon/serial_podcast_data), and maps from the [Maryland State Data Center](http://www.mdp.state.md.us/MSDC/Zipcode_map/2012/zip12idx.shtml).
